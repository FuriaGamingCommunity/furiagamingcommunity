# Furia Gaming Community - Theme [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nottu2584/furiagamingcommunity.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/nottu2584/furiagamingcommunity)
Custom theme for *[Furia Gaming Community](http://furiaguild.com)*, based on the official [twenty-sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/furiagamingcommunity/) 1.0 theme from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/author/wordpressdotorg/). It does **not act as a child theme** as it is intended to be heavily modified and might divert further in future versions.

This theme functions as a hub for *Furia Gaming Community*, it is highly encouraged to use it along with [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/) and [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/), as it uses both plugin capabilities all around its templates.
